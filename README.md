A simple web app for checking releases of various Github projects. Runs on Your computer - just download the code and open _track.html_ file in Your browser. Add or remove Your favourite projects to the list. The list is saved to the local browser storage and cached for 1 day.
Github limits API requests to 60 per hour, so be careful with the list size :)
