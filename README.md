A simple web app for checking releases of Github projects. Download the code and open 'track.html' file in Your browser. Remove or add Your favourite projects to the list. The list is saved to the local browser storage and cached for 1 day. Github limits requests to 60 per hour, so be careful with the list of projects :) You can also edit the list of Your favorite projects directly in the code, the list is on the top of 'track.js' file. 

A default list of projects You should see on the first run:
