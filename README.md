A simple web app for checking releases of variuos Github projects. Download the code and open _track.html_ file in Your browser. Remove or add Your favourite projects to the list. The list is saved to the local browser storage and cached for 1 day. Github limits API requests to 60 per hour, so be careful with the list size :)

You can edit the default list on the top of [track.js](https://github.com/lmnn/trackProject/blob/72803be2490c4f214194893648ebf83edd7f39d4/track.js#L2) file.
